***Author's Experience And About The Recipe:***
I've never quite cared for the traditional fresh strawberry pie. Strawberries, especially when they're in season, are so sweet and flavorful, I've never understood why anyone would want to cover them with all that "goo". Does that stuff have a name anyways?
Baking the strawberries, just like you would with blueberries or blackberries, brings out their natural sweetness and juices. Paired with some citrus juice and zest, the only goo-ing will be over the finished product. Goooo...Gaaaaah....Ooooohhh...Mmmmmm...PIE!
